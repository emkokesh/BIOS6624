## Project 1 Status Update (EDA started)

### Repository structure
- `Background/` – project description / references
- `Code/` – analysis scripts
- `DataRaw/` – raw data folder 
- `DataProcessed/` – cleaned/derived datasets
- `Reports/` – knitted outputs / writeups

### Code files created
- `Code/Project1_EDA.Rmd` – initial data loading + structure checks + baseline exposure creation
- `Code/Project1_Analysis_Frequentist.Rmd` – placeholder for frequentist modeling
- `Code/Project1_Analysis_Bayesian.Rmd` – placeholder for Bayesian modeling

### EDA progress (Project1_EDA.Rmd)
Completed the following initial checks and setup:
- Loaded the raw CSV and standardized variable names
- Dropped the extra index column (`x`)
- Inspected the dataset structure
- Confirmed longitudinal structure:
  - number of rows and distinct subjects
  - observed year range (min/max `years`)
  - visit counts per year and visits per subject summary
- Verified treatment indicator behavior across time:
  - summarized `art` by `years` (proportion `art == 1` and missingness) to confirm baseline vs on treatment pattern
- Created a subject-level baseline exposure:
  - extracted `hard_drugs` at `years == 0` and merged onto all follow-up rows as `hard_drugs_bl`
  - summarized the number of subjects by baseline hard-drug status and quantified baseline missingness
